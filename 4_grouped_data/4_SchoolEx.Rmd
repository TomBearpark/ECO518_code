## Problem 1

*Estimate a linear regression of the average test score (testscr) on
student-teacher ratio, computers per student, and expenditures per
student. Determine whether the three variables have explanatory power by
an F-Test of the hypothesis that all three have zero coefficients and
via the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The latter can be computed
from an F-statistic: The BIC rejects the restriction when the
F-statistic exceeds the log of the sample size.*

```{r}
N <- length(df$avginc)
reg1 <- "testscr ~ str + comp_stu + expn_stu"
lm1 <- lm(data = df, formula(reg1))
```

The F stat is 14.96.

```{r}
summary(lm1)
```

```{r}
compare_models <- function(lm_restricted, lm_unrestricted, N){
    
    RSSR <- sum(lm_restricted$residuals^2)
    RSSU <- sum(lm_unrestricted$residuals^2)
    k    <- length(lm_unrestricted$coefficients) - length(lm_restricted$coefficients) 
    
    Fstat <- ((RSSR - RSSU) / k) / (RSSU / (N-k-1))
    pVal  <- pf(Fstat, k, N-k-1, lower.tail = FALSE)
    
    BIC_R <- N * log(RSSR / N) + length(lm_restricted$coefficients)  * log(N)
    BIC_U <- N * log(RSSU / N) + length(lm_unrestricted$coefficients)  * log(N)
    
    lowerBIC <- ifelse(BIC_R < BIC_U, "restricted", "unrestricted")

    return(
      tibble(Fstat = Fstat, pVal = pVal, 
             BIC_R = BIC_R, BIC_U = BIC_U, logN = log(N), 
             lowest_BIC_model = lowerBIC))
}
lm0 <- lm(data = df, testscr ~ 1)
comparison_1 <- compare_models(lm0, lm1, N)
comparison_1
```

-   BIC is smallest for the true model. BIC is smallest for the more
    complex model

    -   We can also see that the F-stat is larger than the log of the
        sample size, so we reject the restriction

-   F stat strongly rejects the Null that the coefficients aren't
    jointly significant

```{r}
Anova(lm1)

```

```{r}
# run a clustered version
lm1_c <- lm_robust(formula(reg1), data = df, cluster = county)
summary(lm1_c)
```

## Problem 2

*Do the same thing with a regression that adds the demographic
variables: Average income, subsidized meals, calWorks per cent, and
English learners percent. Again check whether the three "policy
variables have explanatory power using an F test and BIC. Here you may
need to extract the covariance matrix of coefficients from the lm()
output to construct the F or chi-squared statistic.*

```{r}
reg2 <- paste0(reg1, " + avginc + meal_pct + calw_pct + el_pct")
lm2 <- lm(data = df, formula(reg2))
```

```{r}
compare_models(lm_restricted = lm1, lm_unrestricted = lm2, N = N)
```

```{r}
summary(lm2)
```

```{r}
Anova(lm2)
```

-   Once again, our tests prefer the more complex model

```{r}
lm2_c <- lm_robust(formula(reg2), data = df, cluster = county)
summary(lm2_c)
```

## Problem 3

*Repeat the previous estimations and tests in models that add county
fixed effects. In R using lm(), this is accomplished by just adding
"county" to the list of right-hand side variables. (county is a "factor"
in the R dataframe, so R automatically converts it into the appropriate
array of dummy variables when including it in a regression.)*

```{r}
reg3.1 <- paste0(reg1, "+ county")
lm3.1 <- lm(data = df, formula(reg3.1))
lm3.1_c <- lm_robust(data = df, formula(reg3.1), cluster = county)


reg3.2 <- paste0(reg2, "+ county")
lm3.2 <- lm(data = df, formula(reg3.2))
lm3.2_c <- lm_robust(data = df, formula(reg3.2), cluster = county)
```

```{r}
compare_models(lm1, lm3.1, N)
```

-   This time, our model doesn't want us to choose the extra complexity
    in the BIC.

-   However, our F-stat approach prefers the more complex model

```{r}
vars <- c("str", "comp_stu", "expn_stu", 
          "avginc", "meal_pct", "calw_pct", "el_pct" )
p <- plot_summs(lm1, lm3.1, coefs = vars, scale = TRUE, 
                model.names = c("Without County FEs", "With County FEs")) + 
                theme(legend.position = "none")
q <- plot_summs(lm2, lm3.2, coefs = vars, scale = TRUE, 
                model.names = c("Without County FEs", "With County FEs"))
r <- p + (ggplot() + theme_void()) + q
ggsave(r, file = paste0(out, "3_comparison_with_FEs.png"), height = 5, width = 9)
```

## Problem 4

*The districts vary greatly in size. Average scores might have more
sampling variation in small districts. Plot the squared residuals from
the estimated model in 2 against the total enrollment variable. Estimate
a linear regression of these squared residuals on 1/enrl_tot. Use the
inverse of these predicted values as the weights argument in lm() (or
otherwise estimate the corresponding weighted regression estimates) in
the question 2 regression.*

First, lets plot the squared residuals against the total enrollment
variable.

```{r}
df$u2 <- lm2$residuals
df$sqr_u2 <- lm2$residuals ^ 2
p4 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = enrl_tot, y = sqr_u2)) + 
  geom_point(alpha= .7) + 
  xlab("Total Enrollment") + ylab("Squared Residuals") + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm)
ggsave(p4, file = paste0(out, "4_resids_vs_enrollment.png"), height = 5, width = 5)
```

Lets also plot the squared residuals against the inverse of total
enrollment, since that relationship is what we are going to use for our
weighting scheme.

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = 1/enrl_tot, y = sqr_u2)) + 
  geom_point(alpha= .7) + 
  xlab("Inverse of Total Enrollment") + ylab("Squared Residuals") + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm)
```

We can estimate a linear regression, to calculate the weights...

```{r}
df$inv_enrl_tot <- 1 / df$enrl_tot
lm4_w <- lm(data = df, sqr_u2 ~ inv_enrl_tot)
```

Next we run a regression weighted by the inverse of the residuals

```{r}
df$weights_lm4 <- 1 / lm4_w$fitted.values
lm4 <- lm(data = df, formula(reg2), weights = df$weights_lm4)
summary(lm4)
```

Compare model 2 to this weighted version...

```{r}
png(file = paste0(out, "4_coef_plot_weighted_vs_2.png")w, height = 1000, width = 1200, res=200)
print(plot_summs(lm2, lm4, scale = TRUE, model.names = c("Unweighted", "Weighted")))
dev.off()

```

## Problem 5

For at least two of the above regression models, calculate standard
errors clustered by county. This is done very easily with the vcovCL()
function from the sandwich package --- so easily that if you're doing it
this way you might want to see how much difference it makes in all of
the above regressions.

```{r}
png(file = paste0(out, "5_coef_plot_cluster.png"), height = 1000, width = 1200, res=200)
plot_summs(lm2, lm2, scale = TRUE, 
           robust = list(FALSE, c(cluster = df$county)), 
           model.names = c("OLS SEs", "County-Clustered SEs"))
dev.off()
```

This is done in code throughout. General comment - clustering doesn't
make much difference in this setup.

## Problem 6

*Estimate a random effects model, with county effects. In R, use the
lme() function from the nlme package to estimate the 7-variable
regression, with random effects by county. You do this by giving lme the
argument random = ˜1 \| county. Also use the argument method="ML", so
that the estimation is by maximum likelihood.*

```{r}
RE <- lme(data = df, formula(reg2), random = ~1 | county, method = "ML") 
summary(RE)$tTable
```

```{r}
summary(RE)
```

## Problem 7

Compare the random effects 7-variable model to the fixed effects model.
In R, you can do this by re-estimating the fixed-effect model with the
gls()function from the nlme package, again being sure to use method="ML"
argument. The summary() function applied to either random effects or
fixed effects models computed this way deliver both log likelihood and
BIC values, so the models can be compared both by afrequentist
chi-squared test based on the log likelihood and via the BIC.

```{r}
FE <- gls(data = df, formula(paste0(reg2, "+ county")), method = "ML") 
summary(FE)$tTable[1:8, ]
```

## Problem 8

Finally, for the random effects model, use a regression of its squared
residuals on 1/(total enrollment) to generate weights for a weighted
random effects estimation; see if this improves likelihood and/or
changes important estimates. [Note: I think that in the nlme estimation
functions the "weights" arguments are variance scales --- the inverse of
the weights used in lm(). So you would use a weights= ˜w argument to
lme() if you used weights=1/w in lm()].

```{r}
df$re_sqr_resid <- RE$residuals[,"county"]^2
lm8_w           <- lm(data = df,  re_sqr_resid ~ inv_enrl_tot)
df$re_weights   <- lm8_w$fitted.values

RE_w <- lme(data = df, formula(reg2), random = ~1 | county, 
            method = "ML", weights = ~re_weights) 
summary(RE_w)$tTable
```

## Problem 9

Be ready to discuss: Does the evidence favor an important effect from
the "controllable" variables? The sizes and signs of the estimated
effects, not just the significance levels of tests, should inform your
views on this.

```{r}

comp_df <- data.frame(
  df,
  model_1 = lm1$fitted.values, 
  model_2 = lm2$fitted.values, 
  model_3 = lm3.2$fitted.values)

p9 <- (ggplot(data = comp_df) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = model_1, y = model_2, color = avginc)) + 
  scale_color_viridis() + 
  geom_abline(slope = 1, color = "red") + 
  ggtitle("Comparison of fitted values") + 
    theme(legend.position = "none")) + (
ggplot(data = comp_df) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = model_2, y = model_3, color = avginc)) + 
  scale_color_viridis() + 
  geom_abline(slope = 1, color = "red") + 
  ggtitle("Comparison of fitted values"))
ggsave(p9, file = paste0(out, "9_fitted_values_comparison.png"), height = 6, width = 9)
```

```{r}
library(caret)
obj <- featurePlot(x = df[vars], y = df$testscr)

png(file = paste0(out, "0_feature_plot.png"))
print(obj)
dev.off()


```

```{r}
# try a lasso regression 
library(glmnet)
y <- df$testscr %>% as.matrix()
X <- model.matrix(formula(paste0(reg2, "+ log(avginc) + avginc^2")), df)

# Helped function for processing results
get_results = function(fit){
    tmp_coeffs <- coef(fit)
    myResults <- data.frame(
        feature = tmp_coeffs@Dimnames[[1]][ which(tmp_coeffs != 0 ) ], #intercept included
        coef    = tmp_coeffs              [ which(tmp_coeffs != 0 ) ]  #intercept included
    )
    return(myResults)
}

fit <-  cv.glmnet(X, y)
png(paste0(out, "A_lasso.png"))
  plot(fit)
dev.off()

```

```{r}
get_results(fit)
```
